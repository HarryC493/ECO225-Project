However, there are about 10,000 missing data in the number of reviews per month, so we may need to decide later on how to treat these missing data.\n",

    "The second row is the average number for each variable. Taking the response variable price as an example, the average price of staying per night in houses registered at Airbnb in 2019 in New York was 152.72 US dollars. It was interesting to realize that, the average minimum number of nights required to stay is a week, and the average available days per year is 131.6 days. This indicates that not a lot of houses allow users to stay for one or two nights, and there are lots of houses that are not available throughout the year. \n",

    "The third row is the standard deviation, which is a measurement of how spread out is the variable. It was interesting to note that most variables, including price, number of minimum nights, number of host listings, and availability are quite spread out, meaning that there are minorities of extreme values in the dataset. This might post threat to validity of the regression model, which we will investigate later on.\n",
